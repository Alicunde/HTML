### [Select](components/Select)
#### HTML + CSS

One of the most popular objects is the select fields. The proliferation of advanced JavaScript-based select fields has supplied the general need for them. On the other hand, in practically all cases the advantages of continuing to use a native select are greater than those of using a JavaScript-based select.

This component customizes the overall appearance of the select, adding a positioned icon using the Background tag and an SVG.

```
<div class="Select">
    <select>
        <option>This is a select</option>
    </select>
</div>
```
