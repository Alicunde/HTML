### [Button](components/Button)
#### HTML + CSS

Set of buttons with icons built in CSS. Unfortunately the use of classes is necessary to define the types and colors. I recommend you consult the CSS and customize them. The icons are positioned absolutely on the object, basically to offer dynamic behavior towards custom fonts.

```
<button type="button" class="cancel">Cancel</button>
```
