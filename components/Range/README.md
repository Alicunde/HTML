### [Range](components/Range)
#### HTML + CSS

Okay, the native HTML Range is too basic. Reason why it is necessary to use any of the thousands of scripts that exist on the internet. We have included this Range due to its funny and convoluted CSS, I recommend you check how the vertical lines of it have been made. I know that many have tried and few have succeeded, basically I have not found it anywhere.

```
<div class="Range">
    <input type="range" min="0" max="10" step="1" value="5">
</div>
```
