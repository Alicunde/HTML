### [Counter](components/Counter)
#### HTML + CSS

Very unoriginal object. I have included it in this repository due to the constant use of it in practically any professional landing.

```
<div class="Counter">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <i class="las la-dog"></i>
            <b>232</b>
            <span>Clients</span>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
```
