### [Slide](components/Slide)
#### HTML + CSS

It is my opinion, but this is the most simplified and elegant Slide on the market. It does not make use of duplicate HTML elements for functionality and elegantly resolves controls. It doesn't make use of finite number classes and, thank goodness, it doesn't make use of absolute positioning for dynamic content slides.

It is important to emphasize that this Slide does not offer a design, it offers a structure with the possibility of applying the design that you are interested in applying.

```
<div class="Slide">
    <a id="0" href="#0"></a>
    <div>
        <div>
            2
        </div>
    </div>
    <a id="1" href="#1"></a>
    <div>
        <div>
            1
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```
