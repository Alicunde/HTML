### [Alert](components/Alert)
#### HTML + CSS + ICON FONT

Set of simple alerts, selected by role and class. We use an icon font, although they are not icons using HTML tags. The reason is clear, an icon in an alert is not semantic. If you want to use another font, modify the CSS.

```
<div role="alert">That is a warning alert</div>
```
